# learn2gether-api-server

Currently, working on Microsoft sing in...
Wish me luck, hate Microsoft api

Well what happened?

I got distracted playing Valorant and I have done some Server and Infrastructure work...
I completely lost my streak and got distracted by a lot of things.
I hope I will continue the work on my projects.-. 
Maybe I will write a blog about some other things I can't push to Git. We will see.
